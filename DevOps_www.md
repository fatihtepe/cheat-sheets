## Discovering AWS
You might realise that it’s probably near impossible to dive into 
each service and completely understand how they work and most likely,
you don’t really need to know the exact ins and outs. But, having a basic 
understanding on each service can be a major benefit as a developer, architect 
or administrator. It makes it easier to see if there is an already existing solution
for your problem at hand.

So, I dove into each and every service to figure out what it
exactly was for and how it works in the basics. I tried to
experiment with as many components as possible (time and
money permitting, I didn’t want to spend 15.000$ on 
AWS Data Exchange). I tried to capture what the 
service does in a single one-liner to give 
you a global overview.

I think most of them are correct enough but if you have any suggestions 
or corrections, please tell me!

## How To: Become Invisible on the Web Using Linux

‘Tails’ is a Debian based Linux distribution renowned by Edward Snowden for is privacy capabilities. With a simple design, it is very easy to use by anyone and offers a host of security features preinstalled to make your online experience totally anonymous. Note that Tails is 100% dedicated to online privacy, and is not a suitable for gaming, media production, office work, or casual use. The best way to get the most out of Tails is by downloading it onto a ‘bootable’ USB key and plugging it into any public or private computer to instantly become invisible wherever you go.
The main safeguard put in place by this distro is the TOR network. TOR hides your IP address by randomly running your data through a series of TOR nodes before hitting the main server. That way, if the server company wants to see your IP all they will see is the last node that the TOR ran through (which is some random IP not connected to you). Also, all of your data sent through TOR is encrypted, so anyone listening in on your data stream will only see gibberish.
